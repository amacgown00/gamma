Training System - Python solution

<p>
The purpose of this project is to deconstruct SFLMS to achieve on-time training completion and improve information accessibility. 

The approach is to understand the nesting structure of the SFLMS components and organize its tokens in a way that mirrors Dave Zimmerman's Training Tracker, a canonically understood and effective system that was retired upon the company-wide implementation of SFLMS Enterprise.

The output will reveal how trainings are grouped prior to engaging  the SFLMS interface.
